So... first blog post ever ey..?

Let's discuss the history of pies.

In the late stone age, early humans discovered pastry. Pastry comes from pastry bushes and although rare in 2020, was a common weed in most gardens back then. 

In order to extract pastry from a pastry bush though, the battle can be fierce. Pastry bushes have absolutely no intention of giving you the pastry.

Early humans discovered that the most effective way to extract pastry is to scare the bush with fire.

Hence, the first use of fire was to make pie.

Also fire is needed to cook pie.
